*************************************************************************************
The project is aimed at creating a visual Three-Dimensional graphics model of a coal 
resource underlying the surace of earth. This computer orebody modeling project starts
with a review of existing drill hole sample data, then the drill hole sample files are
set-up to provide all the quantitative and qualitative information necessary to build
a resource model. From there, the project can provide the user with the following things.
1. Three Dimensional model representing the above surface of the mining area. 
2. Cross-Sectional, longitudinal view of each borehole showing the lithological
   distribution in the borehole.
3. Three Dimensional view of borehole distribution below the surface.
4. Three Dimensional representation of the underlying coal seam.
5. Resource Estimation done using Inverse Distance interpolation. (to be implemented)
6. Contour plot of the surface of the mining area. (needs much improvement)
Some of the above implemented modules are in good state and some need various improvements.
Improvements can be done by anybody interested in working further on the project.
